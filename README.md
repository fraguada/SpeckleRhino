Speckle for Rhino
=================

This repo contains two projects that form the Speckle Rhino client:
1. SpeckleRhinoUI: A Node.js Project for developing the Javascript / Bootstrap / jQuery interface.  At the moment, a lot of functionality is missing from the project setup.  It is not recommended people mess with this yet.
2. SpeckleRhinoChromium: A C# project which depends on CefSharp to create a UI panel (SpeckleRhinoUI) with Rhino 5 for Windows.  A copy of SpeckleRhinoUI is already a part of this project.

Development Notes:
-----------
- This project is developed in Visual Studio 2017
- The SpeckleRhinoUI project depends on Node.js Tools for Visual Studio
